\title{Calculate \eqn{PVAF}}
\usage{
get.PVAF(Y = NULL, Q = NULL, CDM.obj = NULL, model = "GDINA")
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A required \code{N} × \code{I} matrix or data.frame consisting of the responses of \code{N} individuals
to \code{I} items. Missing values should be coded as \code{NA}.}

\item{Q}{A required binary \code{I} × \code{K} matrix containing the attributes not required or required, coded
as 0 or 1, to master the items. The \code{i}th row of the matrix is a binary indicator vector indicating
which attributes are not required (coded as 0) and which attributes are required (coded as 1) to master item \code{i}.}

\item{CDM.obj}{An object of class \code{CDM.obj}. Can can be NULL, but when it is not NULL, it enables
rapid verification of the Q-matrix without the need for parameter estimation.
@seealso \code{\link[Qval]{CDM}}.}

\item{model}{Type of model to be fitted; can be \code{"GDINA"}, \code{"LCDM"}, \code{"DINA"}, \code{"DINO"},
\code{"ACDM"}, \code{"LLM"}, or \code{"rRUM"}. Default = \code{"GDINA"}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{matrix}, which consisted of \eqn{PVAF} for each item and each possible attribute mastery pattern.
}
\description{
The function is able to caculate the proportion of variance accounted for (\eqn{PVAF}) for all items
after fitting \code{CDM} or directly.
}
\details{
The intrinsic essence of the GDI index (as denoted by \eqn{\zeta_{2}}) is the weighted variance of
 all \eqn{2^{K\ast}} attribute mastery patterns' probabilities of correctly responding to
 item \eqn{i}, which can be computed as:
 \deqn{
 \zeta^2 =
 \sum_{l=1}^{2^K} \pi_{l}{(P(X_{pi}=1|\mathbf{\alpha}_{l}) - P_{i}^{mean})}^2
}
where \eqn{\pi_{l}} represents the prior probability of mastery pattern \eqn{l};
\eqn{P_{i}^{mean}=\sum_{k=1}^{2^K}\pi_{l}P(X_{pi}=1|\mathbf{\alpha}_{l})} is the weighted average of the correct
response probabilities across all attribute mastery patterns. When the q-vector
is correctly specified, the calculated \eqn{\zeta^2} should be maximized, indicating
the maximum discrimination of the item.

Theoretically, \eqn{\zeta^{2}} is larger when \eqn{\mathbf{q}_{i}} is either specified correctly or over-specified,
unlike when \eqn{\mathbf{q}_{i}} is under-specified, and that when \eqn{\mathbf{q}_{i}} is over-specified, \eqn{\zeta^{2}}
is larger than but close to the value of \eqn{\mathbf{q}_{i}} when specified correctly. The value of \eqn{\zeta^{2}} continues to
increase slightly as the number of over-specified attributes increases, until \eqn{\mathbf{q}_{i}} becomes \eqn{\mathbf{q}_{i1:K}}.
Thus, \eqn{\zeta^{2} / \zeta_{max}^{2}} is computed to indicate the proportion of variance accounted for by \eqn{\mathbf{q}_{i}}
, called the \eqn{PVAF}.

## generate Q-matrix and data
K <- 3
I <- 20
example.Q <- sim.Q(K, I)

## calculate PVAF directly
PVAF <-get.PVAF(Y = example.data$dat, Q = example.Q)
print(PVAF)

## caculate PVAF after fitting CDM
example.CDM.obj <- CDM(example.data$dat, example.Q, model="GDINA")
PVAF <-get.PVAF(CDM.obj = example.CDM.obj)
print(PVAF)
